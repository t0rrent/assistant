# assistant
To use this assistant program you will need the following:
- An OpenAI API key
- A Vosk language model

The Vosk language model that works for me is vosk-model-en-us-0.21, you are free to download it at https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models

If built, the jar-with-depedencies can be run with the following files in the same directory:
- assistant-window.config
- openai-config.json
- vosk-config.json

Make sure to configure those last two before using
